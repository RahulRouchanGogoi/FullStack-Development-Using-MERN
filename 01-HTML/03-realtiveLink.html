    <p>
      A relative link in HTML is a hyperlink that specifies the path to a
      resource (like a webpage, image, or file) based on the location of the
      current HTML document. Unlike an absolute link (which includes the full
      URL, such as https://example.com/about.html), a relative link relies on
      the folder structure of your project.
